# ML-Projects
Repository containing many classical Machine Learning Projects (Housing, Titanic, Cancer, Iris and Movie lens).                          
These are the projects that are being told in almost all the online Machine Learning courses.

## 1) Housing Price predictions
This project uses Linear Regression to fit in the data that has features such as **#rooms, #bedrooms** etc and tries to predict based on those features what should be the **price of the house**.

## 2) Titanic Dataset
Every machine learning beginner must know the famous titanic dataset. It contains the details about the passengers onboaord the ship Titanic and usually we predict whether the given person **survived or not**.                                          
If a Logistic Regression classifier is used, it will predict with an accuracy of almost **81%**.

## 3) Cancer Dataset
Also a very popular dataset in which the machine learning model has to predict whether the given patient with the given features of tumour will  be **malignant or bening**.                                                                  
A Suppot Vector Machine with the help of a Grid Search can predict with an accuracy of **95%**.
